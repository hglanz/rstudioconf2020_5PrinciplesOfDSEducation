# Five Principles of Data Science Education

* Reproducibility

* Communication

* Version Control

* Practical Application

* Data Ethics

# Reproducibility

* In one sense, you shouldn't have to look for anything: __re-run code as is__

* If changes are needed (e.g. same analysis/pipeline with slight tweaks): __easy plug-and-play__ 

* See __J.J. Allaire's keynote__ and __Carl Howe's Data Science Education talk__ for all of the ways R/RStudio enable reproducibility!

# Communication

* Data science, statistics, modeling, etc. should __NOT__ be magic!

* __RMarkdown__ and __Shiny__ are only a couple of tools that help bridge the gap between data/computing and storytelling

* Also see __Gordon Shotwell's talk__ on Technical Debt for more on this

# Version Control

* This along with __reproducibility__ speak to the need for the data science pipeline to be __resilient__

* Teams of people need to be able to work simultaneously and seamlessly on data science projects

* __Git integration in RStudio__ is phenomenal for facilitating this!

# Practical Application

* Wearing a football helmet in the classroom is only so useful...

* No matter how good your examples are, nothing beats __the real data science project experience__

* Students need to __learn by doing__ with actual __client-based projects__ at some point in their data science education!

* __R projects; templates provided by RStudio and others; and the diverse use of R packages__ provide wonderful tools for general data science work!

# Data Ethics

* It's been addressed a lot, recently...even in our Google AI keynote, that biases exist and demand attention

* Wikipedia: __"...systemizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct in relation to data, in particular personal data."__

* By providing a vehicle for a vast majority of the data science workflow, RStudio helps to free up more of our time and energy for ensuring good conduct in relation to data!
